# Mnemosyne
## About
Mnemosyne is a payload encryptor that encrypts payloads using keys generated by the xor function.

This encryption works like a charm in AV Evasion.

## How to install it
### - Clone this repository
```
git clone https://github.com/mbxisbankai/Mnemosyne
```
### - Download the zip file from the **<> Code** area

## Usage for mnemosyne.py
Mnemosyne generates a key of the same byte size as the payload, using the xor function.

The key and payload are encrypted printed out in the terminal.

However, the payload should be entered in **base64** format.

To convert your payload to base64, visit <a href="https://gchq.github.io/CyberChef/">CyberChef</a>

Run **mnemosyne.py** and paste in the base64 payload

The output is the Payload length, XOR Encryption key and the Payload; all encoded

## Using build-payload.py
Using the payload builder requires slight editing but nothing too complex.

Just paste the encrypted payload and key from **mnemosyne.py** into the double quotes.
